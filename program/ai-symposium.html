                            critical question emerges: "Where can we
                            strategically apply this transformative technology

                            the strategic deployment of AI within business
                            contexts, offering a blueprint for identifying key
                            use cases. Our focus centers on responsible AI
                            adoption, demonstrating a steadfast commitment to
                            job preservation, facilitating reskilling

                            The technology of AI (artificial intelligence) has

                            things in various areas of our lives. It

                            tasks, solve some of our complex problems, and

                            a new approach. Consequently, a new area of ethical
                            studies, called "AI Ethics," has been instituted for
